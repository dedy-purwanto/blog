- The color in the photos in the store are bit whiter, the reality is the keyboard is more of a gray than white
- Arrow keys takes some getting used to.
- Each keys almost have different feeling depending on the position
- USB hub is enough to power USB drive and slow phone charging
- front slash and ~ takes some getting used to
- O dan P becomes screen brightness setting in mac
- you cannot feel the smoothnes on the first time due to your past typing behaviour on rubber dome or harder switches.
- after trying it for more than a month, I came to realize this keyboard have a totally different feel with any other mechanical / rubber dome keyboard, it's very smooth, still have solid feedback.
