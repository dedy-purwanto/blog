all great people always had a great teachers, mentors, and friends. I don't agree when people say you can "learn anything" on the internet, I more agree with you can "learn easier" with internet. If you want to succeed, find great teachers, mentors, friends, people whom you aspire. See all successful people, Bill Gates (IBM, geek friends), Zuckerberg (genius angel investors, etc), Warren Buffet (his teacher), Steve Jobs (Intel, his geek friends), and see who were they with when they first start.

The problem today is that we tend to settle so easy, we stopped finding bigger fish, we think what we have is good enough and we'll move like river. No, we should move like storm, like a typhoon.
