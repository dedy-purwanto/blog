tell about all the tempting post about the advantage of Dvorak, it's not about speed, but comfort.

tell about how it relates to our own plan to buy hhkb, and they provide printed and blank keycaps, which one should i buy.

But the thing is we are not only typing words, but also utilising shortcuts, especially vim.

maybe there's no plan to move to Dvorak in the near future, but maybe there is in the next 3-6 months. so maybe we should buy printed one first, and then buy the blank keycaps later.

we can also buy other colourful printed and blank keycaps.
