how twitter rearchitect their system years after then went popular, this states that:

* you need to move fast in the beginning
* * in the beginning, you can also move fast by throw more machine/money at the problem.
* * this also means you test less, in technical perspective this is something we against, but if the business is where the cost of risk is less, you can experiment more, and fail safer.
* * see other slides, with hundreds of deploy everyday.
* * so in startup it doesn't necessarily means you have to follow all the technical disciplines, sometimes you need to break them.
* * conclusion 1: don't over engineer your tech in the early phase
*
* * You can always refactor later, the key is to find balance between solution and objective.
