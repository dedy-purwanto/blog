<p>now that's perfect :D, I got my tumblr with a very plain and simple theme, black and gray screen with light blue on the hyperlinks. Comment box was done using Disqus service. Also, I've installed a chrome extension as a shortcut to post to tumblr. Lucky RockMelt browser still can use chrome extension, and somehow this extension doesn't require any authentication at all, weird, maybe that's because I already logged in.</p>&#13;
<p>Now I just need to login to FB frequently just to clean up some zombie posts that has no comments and replies at all.</p>
