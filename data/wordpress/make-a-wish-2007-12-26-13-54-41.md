Let me make a wish..
Let me say a ton of wish..
Let me feel a happiness today..

This year..
Let me make something ..
Let me make you proud ..

Mom, Dad, My Honey..
Let me make more smilies on your face this year..
Let me make a happiness, for the rest of us..

That was my wish, in my deepest heart
I just want to say
It was 19 years since I open my eyes for the very first time
It was 19 years since I saw my first voice loudly
Happy birthday to me..
