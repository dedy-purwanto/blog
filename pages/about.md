Hello,

I currently live in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

I code mostly in python and django.

I took a degree in Software Engineering, and now I'm currently coding at [easyuni](http://www.easyuni.com) for almost 3 years.

My current gear is [Macbook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/), [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com), [vim](http://www.vim.org/), [git](http://www.git-scm.com/), [dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/), and [notational velocity](http://www.notational.net/)

You can also find me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kecebongsoft), [github](https://github.com/kecebongsoft), and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105581558374023241765)

This blog is powered by [pelican](http://www.getpelican.com) and my own custom theme.

If you want to know more about my experience, [check out my CV](/cv.html)
