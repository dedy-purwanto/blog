Hello,

I code mostly in python and django.

I'm currently coding at [easyuni](http://www.easyuni.com) for almost 3 years.

My current gear is [Macbook Air](), [iTerm2](), [vim](), [git](), [dropbox](), and [notational velocity]()

You can also find me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kecebongsoft), [github](https://github.com/kecebongsoft), and [Google+]()

This blog is powered by [pelican]() and my own custom theme.

If you want to know more about my experience, [check out my CV](/cv.html)
