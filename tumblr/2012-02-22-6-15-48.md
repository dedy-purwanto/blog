> I'm not more than an average boy, sometimes I spaced out, looking at empty corners with thoughts, maybe that's why I love to wait for bus, or riding train, because that's the only time I usually able to have some thoughts, or maybe when I walk to get some lunch outside. Oh, and I do some computer stuff too.
