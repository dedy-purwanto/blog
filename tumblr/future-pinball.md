<p>Today I got so excited trying Future Pinball. Future Pinball is a pinball machine simulator where you can design your own table and play it. There are many features, such as scripting, customization, etc. I consider the graphic was good, high resolution texture, shaders, etc. You can also download the existing tables from their website, or other fanbase site.</p>&#13;

You can download it from<a href="http://www.futurepinball.com/">http://www.futurepinball.com/</a>, and right after you download it, don't forget to download some tables from the website, and DON'T FORGET to try tables from this website as well:<a href="http://www.blindmankind.tecnopinball.org/">http://www.blindmankind.tecnopinball.org/</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>If you're using Vista or Windows 7, remember to run the program in Administrator mode. Have fun playing!.</p>
