> I drew a line on a sand once, and then it came the time where those were stripped away by the ashes of the sea. I can still catch the glimpse of it although times have brought it away from me into the ocean. Memories, life's remnants, the pieces of my life that dwells inside, form scars and thought me of every lesson I know today.
