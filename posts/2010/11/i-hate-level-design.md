<p>Yes, that's true. Level design and art related stuff just drive me crazy, I don't know, it seems like its very easy to be done, I even have all the necessary blue prints, all I need to do is aligning these assets to the provided blue prints, but my hand can't move at all, it's really hard to get my mood when it comes to art and design. I can do coding for hours without being tired or even bored. Maybe I wasn't born for this thing. Still need to copy around 13 blueprints before I started coding, where's my mountain dew anyway?</p>
