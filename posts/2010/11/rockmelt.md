Started to get bored with RockMelt, I decided to remove it from my launch tray and restore my chrome. I start to hate the Edge, it's very cool and at the same time its very annoying, I think they can modify the layout to somehow more compact. 

I also hate the "Search Google" option, when the returns shows up and I try to click a link, it will replace the current tab with the one that I clicked, it was either my stupidness or there are really no option to change this. Nevermind, hello Chrome.
