Few months ago there was a house mate in this apartment who left without paying the rent for almost half a year, the owner told me not to open the door for her until she settle all her outstanding payments, but today somehow she managed to open the door and bring her (maybe) boyfriend along, and take all her stuff (which basically just clothes), now I don't know what should I say to the owner, hopefully I'm not involved into this. 

Damn, I was really in a good mood before, playing with my tools, and now that wench just ruined everything.
