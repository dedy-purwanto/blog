title: PyCharm: Staying at home row with quick-list
date: 2015-10-29

Something that draw me back from using IDE is that I have to memorise a lot of
keyboard shortcuts, and they are unlike vim which you can arrange in a certain
order and have it triggered by your hand conveniently like:
    
    ,ij # Join lines
    ,rd # Run debugging server
    ,fu # Run file browser

As you can see, in vim you can have all this nice key sequence to trigger actions,
and you finger stays in the home row, thanks to vim different modes. But it's 
not like that in IDE:
    
    Ctrl+Shift+N # Find files
    Ctrl+N # Find class
    Shift+Esc # Some other commands
    
Not only they are far from each other, it also often twisted your fingers in many
ways, I have complained before that I have pinky problems, I have to twist my
fingers just to get to some actions. PyCharm is no difference, the keymap
are so many and not only sometimes it hurts, I often forget which is which.

So to simplify, PyCharm have this thing called Quick List, it lets you list
down all your favorite commands, and dedicate a shortcut to it, so you can have
things like Find Class, Find File, New Project, Run, Debug etc in a single
list which you can search just like any other PyCharm tool window.

In my case, I set the shortcut as Alt+Minus, it doesn't hurt at all because I'm
still staying at the home row, and I can trigger either with one or two hand like
below:

I'm planning to use this for sometime and we'll see how it improves the workflow.
At least right now the thing I like about it is that now I can see the action name
I want to trigger instead of using the shortcuts and triggering the wrong commands,
or using the global search which sometimes show too many results or I have to type
longer keyword to get to it.
