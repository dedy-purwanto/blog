title: PyCharm: Quick refactoring
date: 2015-10-29

One thing I really like in PyCharm is you can do quick refactoring very easy and
PyCharm will settle (almost) all the stuff for you. For example, here is me trying
to refactor a single string of command to be something more sophisticated:

As you can see, I can take the whole string and put it in a variable, I then
proceed to take some part of the string, in this case is the filename of the
config source, into another variable. After that, I make it able to switch
between different configs using the if statement, all using PyCharm quick refactoring
features.
