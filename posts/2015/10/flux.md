title: Flux
date: 2015-10-28

Lately my eyes is very sore, I'm not sure if it's due to haze, or just being
in front of screen for too long. Either way, it's concerning, often times it
affects my productivity; I get tired too fast, and lose my mood to do anything.

Right now I don't have enough courage to go and check it with doctors. I'm a
long-time user of Flux, when I still frequently use my Macbook Air, I have it
all the time, it didn't brought that much difference back then. But lately I
have been using it in my Windows machine, I set it to be a bit yellow-ish during
daytime, and now the difference is much better.

I can stare on the screen for much longer without having any eyesore, in fact
I feel more cozy. I hope this can mitigate any possible health risk and I will
of course check with doctors in the future.
