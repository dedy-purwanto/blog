I once maintain my own vimfiles repository, but vim plugins are now easier to manage using vundle and I realize it's time to only rely on my .vimrc without anything else (not .vim, not plugins, etc). So I created a <a href="https://github.com/kecebongsoft/dotfiles">new repository</a> and put all my dotfiles there, add some submodules and setup script to make it easy, oh, and I removed my vimfiles as well.
