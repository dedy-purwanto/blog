Title: 72Solarized Theme

For the past few hours I've been trying to modify the default *notmyidea*
theme that came from pelican to be more look alike my 
<a href='http://kecebongsoft.tumblr.com'>Tumblr blog</a>. Why? Because
I love solarized, and simplicity.

Why 72? I am planning to make this blog to use fixed with font with 72 
columns. Which will make it extremelly easy to read, and suits my *brief*
blogging style.

It turned out it wasn't that easy, especially I am a complete idiot in
web design. So this is all that was. I will try to improve as more posts
will be here. But at least it got the simplicity already.
